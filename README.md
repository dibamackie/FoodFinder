# Recipe Finder Website

This is my first web project, created as the final project for my initial web development class. The Recipe Finder website allows users to search for recipes by entering one or multiple ingredients. It is built using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Search Recipes**: Enter one or more ingredients to find matching recipes.
- **Contact Page**: Users can send messages directly to my email address using a free API.
- **Payment Page**: The payment page validates credit card and address information without needing a backend server.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The structure of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling for the website.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality scripted directly in the HTML pages.
